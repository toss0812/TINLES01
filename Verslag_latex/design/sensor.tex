Each sensor module has their own sensor, Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) module, battery and a microcontroller. For this project, two sensor modules to detect movement in house are used. The first sensor module uses a Reed sensor. The other sensor module uses a Passive infrared(PIR) sensor. 
When a sensor module detect a change, it will send the data over BLE to the Hub.
