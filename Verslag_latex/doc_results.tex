The sensor modules are most of the time in power-down sleep mode to reduce power usage. To wake a sensor module, a pin change interrupt is used. The pin change interrupt will be triggered when a sensor detect a change. The sensor module will then send the data from the sensor over BLE to the Hub. After sending the data, it will go back to sleep.
